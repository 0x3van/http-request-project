# Desmos Packet Modifier
modifies desmos packets to allow any user to attach an image directly to the website

# How to Use/Build:
if you haven't already, install typescript by typing in `npm install -g typescript`. 

Once you are done, head over to the src folder and open the CLI from there. From there, type in `npx tsc ./index.ts` for it to compile.

Go back to the main folder, attach an image called image.png in the root folder and type in `node build`. 

Enjoy
